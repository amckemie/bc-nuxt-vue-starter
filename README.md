# Overview

> A BigCommerce + Nuxt + Vue Storefront UI Starter app

This starter app is **not production ready**. Rather, it is intended to be used as sample, starter code when building a headless ecommerce storefront. 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
